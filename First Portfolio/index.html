        <h2>An Essay about Cow</h2><br>
        <p>‘The cow is one of the farm and domestic animals. In rural areas, people domesticate cows for milk production, which offers several advantages. Milk is a good source of protein and calcium, and enhances our immune system. Apart from direct milk consumption, it is also used for other dairy products like cheese, butter curd, cream, etc. 
            <br>

In the Hindu religion, the cow is considered a sacred animal and is worshipped by many. According to Hindu legends, a cow is considered the fertile Mother Earth (Prithvi). To protect cows, governments and private organisations have established cow shelters, also known as ‘Gaushala’ where people provide food, shelter and care to old, abandoned, unproductive, infertile and infirm cows. This is a very selfish and inhuman activity, as people only domesticated cows and other farm animals until they were productive or used in agricultural activities. <br>

The cow is also important for both economic and ecological factors. In rural areas, cow dung is used as manure for agricultural production. Cow dung can be recycled into the soil by earthworms and dung beetles. Sometimes, the cow dung dries out and remains on the pasture, creating an area of grazing land which is unpalatable to livestock. <br>

Another importance of cows is the use of their skin in the manufacturing of products. In today’s modern world, a lot of private clothing organisations use cow skin for the manufacturing of shoes, coats, belts and bags. In vehicles also, cow skin is used to design interiors and furniture. Even sports equipment, like gloves and balls, are made of cow skin. <br>

Cows are an essential part of our environment and help in maintaining ecological balance. Apart from economic and dairy production, cows also help in maintaining grasslands, preventing the overgrowth of vegetation.’</p>
